# Library Card Automation System

This project automates the generation of library cards for new admission students at the college. The system fetches student details from a CSV file and applies them to a predefined template. Built using React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, this web application streamlines the process of creating and issuing library cards, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual effort.
